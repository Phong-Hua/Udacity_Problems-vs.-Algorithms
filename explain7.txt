Time and space complexity of all classes and its method:
    1. RouteTrieNode:
        a. insert(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        b. insert_handler(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        c. get_node(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        d. get_handler(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        
        *** Space complexity: children is a dictionary that reference to other nodes.
        For worstcase, space complexity can be O(n) if it is the root node. 

    2. RouteTrie:
        a. get_root_handler(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        b. insert_root_handler(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        c. insert_404(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        d. get_404(): O(1) for time complexity and space complexity.
        e. insert(): Time complexity for this methods depends on path and size of array it
        can a path be split into. Since the path can be unlimited, time complexity is O(n).
        Space complexity is O(1).
        f. find(): Time complexity depends on size of parts array. Since, size of parts can be unlimited,
         time complexity is O(n). Space complexity is O(1).

        *** Space complexity is O(n), with n is total size of node.

    3. Router:
        a. add_handler(): time complexity is O(n) since http path is unlimited. Space complexity is O(1).
        b. lookup(): time complexity is O(n) since http path is unlimited. Space complexity is O(1).
        c. __split_path__(): time and space complexity is O(n) since http path is unlimited.
